# Chapp

Live demo: https://chapp1.herokuapp.com/

A chatting app built using node.js and socket.io which allows the functionality to broadcast the messages and have personal chat with your friends.

* You can log in by using a display name which can be anything if you want to chat anonymously don't use your real name here.
* You need to enter a common room name which will be same for everybody if you want to chat in a group or you can create a     private room just for your team.
* The best part is your conversation in this app will be 100% volatile just like your real ones as soon as you left the room   messages will disappear because it is not using any kind of database to store messages.

So be yourself join a room say what you want and forget about it:wink:
